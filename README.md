Flappy Adventure is a modern, web-based reimagining of the classic Flappy Bird game. Developed entirely by an AI assistant (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, as of July 21, 2024), this game showcases the capabilities of AI in game design and development. Players control a character (defaulting to a chicken, but with theme options) navigating through a series of obstacles, aiming to achieve the highest score possible.

## Features

## AI Development Details
This game was fully developed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, an AI assistant created by Anthropic, on July 21, 2024. The development process was guided by user prompts and interactions, showcasing the AI's ability to understand complex requirements, generate code, and provide comprehensive explanations.

### Prompt Used
The initial prompt that led to the development of this game was:

"Create a Flappy Bird-like game using React and deploy it on Vercel."

From this starting point, the AI generated the entire codebase, provided setup instructions, and guided the deployment process.
